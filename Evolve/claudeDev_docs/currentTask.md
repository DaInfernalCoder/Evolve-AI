# Current Task

## Task: Finalize and Test Journal Entry Context Feature

### Objectives:
1. Create a testing plan for the journal entry context feature
2. Implement error handling for journal entry fetching and selection
3. Optimize the code if necessary
4. Create unit tests for the new functionality

### Progress:
- [x] Implement journal entry context feature in `Chat.tsx` and `StartCall.tsx`
- [x] Update system architecture documentation
- [ ] Create a testing plan
- [ ] Implement error handling
- [ ] Optimize code (if needed)
- [ ] Create unit tests

### Testing Plan:
1. Manual Testing:
   - Verify that journal entries are correctly fetched and displayed in the dropdown
   - Ensure that selecting a journal entry updates the context in the `VoiceProvider`
   - Test the voice session with different selected journal entries to confirm context is used
   - Check for any UI/UX issues in the journal entry selection process

2. Error Handling:
   - Implement and test error handling for failed journal entry fetching
   - Add user-friendly error messages for various failure scenarios
   - Ensure the application gracefully handles cases where no journal entries are available

3. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and optimize the time taken to fetch and display journal entries
   - Assess the impact of journal context on AI response time

4. Unit Tests:
   - Create unit tests for the `useJournalEntries` hook
   - Write tests for the journal entry selection logic in `StartCall.tsx`
   - Test the context updating mechanism in `Chat.tsx`

### Next Steps:
1. Implement the testing plan
2. Add error handling code to relevant components
3. Optimize code based on performance testing results
4. Write and run unit tests

### Notes:
- Ensure all tests consider various edge cases and potential user interactions
- Document any discovered issues or limitations for future improvements
- Consider gathering user feedback on the journal entry selection feature once implemented

This document will be updated as the task progresses and new considerations arise.
