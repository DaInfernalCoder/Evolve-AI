# Security Measures

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Evolve AI project to protect user data, ensure system integrity, and maintain compliance with best practices.

## Authentication and Authorization

1. **NextAuth.js Implementation**
   - Secure user authentication using industry-standard protocols
   - Support for multiple authentication providers
   - Proper session management and token handling

2. **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
   - Used for secure information transmission between parties
   - Implemented with appropriate expiration times and refresh mechanisms

3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Implement user roles and permissions to restrict access to sensitive features and data

## Data Protection

1. **Encryption**
   - Use HTTPS for all client-server communications
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest in the database (e.g., using MongoDB's field-level encryption)

2. **Input Validation and Sanitization**
   - Implement strict input validation on both client and server sides
   - Use libraries like `validator.js` for input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks

3. **API Security**
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks
   - Use API keys for external service integrations (e.g., Stripe, Hume AI)

## Infrastructure Security

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Store sensitive information (API keys, database credentials) in environment variables
   - Use `.env` files for local development and secure environment variable management in production

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities
   - Use `npm audit` or similar tools to check for security issues in dependencies

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error handling to prevent information leakage
   - Use generic error messages for clients while logging detailed errors server-side

## Compliance and Best Practices

1. **OWASP Top 10**
   - Regularly review and address the OWASP Top 10 web application security risks

2. **GDPR Compliance**
   - Implement necessary measures for GDPR compliance (if applicable)
   - Provide user data export and deletion functionality

3. **Security Headers**
   - Implement security headers such as Content Security Policy (CSP), X-XSS-Protection, etc.

## Monitoring and Incident Response

1. **Logging**
   - Implement comprehensive logging for security-related events
   - Use a secure logging service to prevent log tampering

2. **Monitoring**
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities or potential security breaches
   - Regularly review logs and system activities

3. **Incident Response Plan**
   - Develop and maintain an incident response plan
   - Conduct regular security drills and updates to the plan

## Third-Party Integrations

1. **Stripe Integration**
   - Follow Stripe's security best practices for handling payment information
   - Use Stripe's libraries and APIs securely to minimize exposure to sensitive payment data

2. **Hume AI Integration**
   - Ensure secure API communication with Hume AI
   - Properly handle and store any sensitive data from AI interactions

## Regular Security Audits

1. **Code Reviews**
   - Conduct regular security-focused code reviews
   - Use automated tools for static code analysis

2. **Penetration Testing**
   - Perform regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities
   - Address identified issues promptly

3. **Security Training**
   - Provide regular security training for the development team
   - Stay updated with the latest security trends and threats

This document will be regularly updated as new security measures are implemented or existing ones are modified. All team members are responsible for adhering to these security practices and reporting any potential security issues immediately.
