2. **To Do:** Tasks selected for the current sprint.
3. **In Progress:** Tasks currently being worked on.
4. **Review:** Completed tasks awaiting review and testing.
5. **Done:** Tasks that have passed review and are completed.

## Documentation Updates

Ensure that all relevant documentation is updated regularly to reflect the latest developments. This includes:

- **`PRD.md`**
- **`system_architecture.md`**
